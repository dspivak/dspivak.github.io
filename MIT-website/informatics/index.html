<h4> Background.</h4>

<a href="http://math.mit.edu/~dspivak/informatics/background.html"> Success is 
founded on information</a>. A tight connection between success (in anything) and 
information. It follows that we should (if we want to be more successful) study 
what information is.

<br><br>

<a href="http://math.mit.edu/~dspivak/informatics/grants/"> Grant proposals</a>. These 
are several grant proposals, some funded, some in the pipeline, others not funded, that 
explain various facets of my research project.<br><br>

<a

post</a>, on John Baez's blog <a 
href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com">Azimuth</a>, about my 
motivations for 
studying this subject. (Here's a <a

<h4>Book.</h4>

<a href="http://math.mit.edu/~dspivak/CT4S.pdf">Category 
Theory for Scientists</a>. This book attempts to show that category theory 
can be applied throughout the sciences as a framework for modeling 
observed phenomena and for communicating results. In order to target a 
scientific audience, the book is example-based rather than proof-based. On 
the <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.6946"> arXiv</a>.

<h4>Papers.</h4>

<a href= 
"http://math.mit.edu/~dspivak/informatics/PixelArrays--SpivakDobsonKumari.pdf">Pixel 
Array Method</a>. Here we give a fast new method for solving systems of 
equations. The 
method returns all solutions for a subset of variables in a given bounding 
box and can be more than 10x faster than other solvers (e.g. quasi-Newton 
methods).<br><br>

Algebraic databases</a>. Joint with Patrick Schultz, Christina
Vasilakopoulou, Ryan Wisnesky. Here we understand attributes and null
values in a database, using algebraic theories. The theoretical
contributions include a notion of algebraic profunctor, a development of
the collage construction, and a new proarrow equipment of "variable
algebras" of a theory.<br><br>

Functorial Data
Migration.</a> This was <a
href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0890540112001010"> published
</a> in the journal <a
href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/08905401">Information and
Computation</a> in 2012. In this paper I show some of the power of the database=category
idea: a morphism of schemas induces data migration functors that transmit states on one
schema to states on the other.  This creates such functionality as views, unions, joins,
projects, selects, etc.  An older version is <a

<a href="http://math.mit.edu/~dspivak/informatics/SD.pdf"> Simplicial
databases</a>.  A geometric model of databases.  In this model, a
"schema" for a database is a labeled simplicial set, whose n-simplicies
correspond to tables with n+1 columns.  We form a simplicial set by taking
the union of such simplices, and doing so reflects the links between
objects of differing types.  The data itself is then a sheaf on the
corresponding site.  This category of databases is closed under limits and
colimits and these functors correspond to common operations on databases,
such as joins, selects, and unions. On the <a
href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0904.2012"> arXiv</a>.<br>

I gave a talk on this subject at the 2008 <a

meeting
in Paris, and wrote a more brief survey of the ideas <a

A primitive version of this talk in which I only discuss the category of

science department.  It can be found <a

<a href="http://math.mit.edu/~dspivak/informatics/HDMSN.pdf">
Higher-dimensional
models of
networks</a>.  In this paper, I make a case that many networks involve interactions
between more than two entities, and as such should not be modeled by graphs but by
simplicial sets.  I give a variety of other models and suggest ways to determine which
model is most applicable for a given situation, and how to transform models from one type
into another.  The paper is written mainly for a CS audience familiar with the basics of
category theory.  It can also be found on the <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/0909.4314">
arXiv</a>.  A more mathematical paper on networks and information processing is in

Database queries and constraints via lifting problems</a>.
(Published by <a
href="http://journals.cambridge.org/repo_A90V5ODg">
Mathematical
structures in computer science</a>.) In this paper I show
that database queries and constraints, especially so-called "graph pattern
queries", are nicely modeled in terms of the algebro-topological notion of <i>
lifting problems </i> (which one encounters, for example, in Quillen's theory
of model categories). The lifting problem is the query and the lifts are the
solutions. Also available on the

<a href="http://math.mit.edu/~dspivak/informatics/monadsInDatabases.pdf">
Kleisli database instances</a>. Here we use monads to allow non-atomic
values in database fields. For example depending on the choice of monad, a
column may contain lists, probability distributions, or vectors of entries
in some foreign table. As an interesting aside, we show that there is a
schema Loop, whose Kleisli T-instances for different monads T completely
capture classical structures of interest, such as directed graphs,
discrete dynamical systems, Markov chains, multi-graphs, finite state
automata, Turing Machines, and square matrices. Also available on the

<a href="http://math.mit.edu/~dspivak/informatics/undirectedWD.pdf">The
operad of wiring diagrams</a>. Here I discuss a symmetric colored operad S
of wiring diagrams, which can be used as a graphical language for database
queries. I also show that the same formalism fits the classical theory of
digital circuits, as well as the notion of plug-and-play and
recursion. Also available on the <a

stream processors. This may have applications to computer hardware design and
neuroscience. Also available on the <a

<a href="http://math.mit.edu/~dspivak/informatics/olog.pdf"> Ologs: a
category-theoretic foundation for knowledge representation</a>. Joint with
Robert E. Kent. In this paper we present an application of basic category
theory to the field of knowledge representation.  Ontology is the study of
what something is, the intrinsic nature of a subject.  Ologs, or ontology
logs, are a framework for recording the results of such a study by breaking
it down into types (objects), aspects (arrows), and facts (commutative
diagrams).  Functors between ologs can create translating dictionaries
between various perspectives on a subject, and set-valued functors amount to
instance data or "real world examples" for the system of concepts an olog.

Category-theoretic analysis of hierarchical protein materials and social
networks</a>. Joint with Tristan Giesa, Elizabeth Wood, and <a

(2011) in
<a
href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0023911">
PLoS ONE</a>. In this paper
we use an olog to rigorously compare and contrast the structure of two
proteins and their resulting behaviors under strain. We then compare this
whole setup with that of a social network, contrived to have the same
olog-theoretic description. The examples reviewed here demonstrate that
the intrinsic nature of these complex systems, which in particular
includes a precise relationship between their structure and their
function, can be effectively represented by an olog. This, in turn, allows
for comparative studies between disparate materials or fields of
application, and result in novel approaches to derive functionality in
hierarchical systems. We discuss opportunities and challenges associated
with the description of complex biological materials by using ologs as a
powerful tool for analysis and design in the context of materiomics, and
we present the potential impact of this approach for engineering, life
sciences, and medicine. On the <a
