<h3>HOMEWORK (from Boyce and DiPrima).</h3>

Homework should be done according to the following guide: <a

Homework
preparation.</a> Repeat the procedure for each topic listed below.<br><br>

In order to do well on the quizzes and tests, you should be able to do all    
of the suggested problems; however, you are not required to actually do
them all on your homework.  Do as many as you need to, in order to feel 
comfortable that you <i> could </i> do any of them.<br>


<h3>Homework 1 (Due 2009/01/13):</h3>
<h4>Topic 1: Direction fields (section 1.1).  </h4>Suggested problems: 1.1 
#1-20.

<h4>Topic 2: Solutions to differential equations and initial value 
problems (section 1.2, 1.3).</h4>  
Suggested problems: 1.2 #1,2,7; 1.3 #7-20.
