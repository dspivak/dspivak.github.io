Dear --,

I have changed my homework policy to take into account the comments I was 
getting. The new homework guide is attached. Please spend 10 minutes 
looking over this email and the new homework guide, and then spend 10 
fewer minutes (i.e. spend only 3 hours and 50 minutes) grading the 
homework this week.

Here is how I want you to grade it. For each Topic, give the student a 
grade of 0 to 3 (as explained below); add up those grades and write the 
sum on the top sheet of their homework. 

For each topic, give the student 1 point for each "Yes" answer to 
questions in the following list (for a total of up to 3 points per 
topic).

1. Did the student do all the steps of the homework guide? 

2. Did the student do a good variety of problems? 

3. How did the student perform on the problems they worked? 
a. If the student did only a few problems, did they do them well? 
b. If the student did many problems and did them less well, did they ask 
relevant questions (in Step 8)?

Thanks, 
David
