Final exam curve questions.  (UPDATED!)</a></h3><br>

<h4><a 
href="http://www.uoregon.edu/~dspivak/teaching/wi08/Student-solutions1.pdf"> 
Here are one student's solutions to the curve questions.  </a>They are 
well done, and all but two are pretty accurate.  The extra credit is 
slightly wrong, and number 14 is incomplete.  I haven't thoroughly checked 
the rest, but it looks right on first glance.  Some of the wording is a 
bit "mathematically 
imprecise", but that's only if you're nit-picky like me. </h4> Remember, 
it's better to understand these solutions than to try to 
memorize them.  Remembering them will come with understanding 
them.<br><hr>


<h3>HOMEWORK (from Shores, <u> Applied Linear Algebra and Matrix 
Analysis </u>)</h3>

<br>

<h4>Homework 1 (Due 1/15):</h4>
Read sections 1.3, 1.4, and 2.1.  Then do:<br>
1.3 # 5,7-9,13;<br>
1.4 # 1-5,7,9,15;<br>
2.1 # 1,4,5,8-10,17.<br>

<h4>Homework 2 (Due 1/22):</h4>
Read sections 2.2, 2.3 (up to p. 75), and 2.4. Then do: <br>
2.2 # 2,4,5,7,8,10 (just do f(A); don't do f(B)),14,27; <br>
2.3 # 1ab,2ab,3ab,4ab,5;<br>
2.4 # 1,4,5ab,6ab,10,14,23,24.<br>


<h4>Homework 3 (Due 1/29):</h4>
Read sections 2.5, 2.6, and 3.1.  Then do: <br>
2.5 # 2abcd, 3 (use inverse matrices!), 5,8,13,15,21; <br>
2.6 # 1ab,3ab,4ab,5ab,6ab,15.<br>

<h4>Homework 4 (Due 2/5):</h4> 
Read section 3.1 and 3.2.  Then do: <br> 
3.1 # 1-8,11,12,14-16,19,22,23; <br>
3.2 # 1-8.
<h5>A firm foundation in the concept 
of vector spaces is crucial 
for your success in the rest of this course!  You should do this 
homework with the intention of really understanding the material as 
well as possible.  <br>	Do it or drop.  Good luck!</h5><br>
