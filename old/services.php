						<p>A category-theoretic analysis of IT infrastructure, data management systems, and data integration processes such as ETL and data warehousing will produce a more insightful understanding of a data ecosystem by:</p>
						<ul>
							<li> Identifying master and reference data, </li>
							<li> Revealing business rules that are implicit in data, </li>
							<li> Uncovering gaps and redundancies in IT processes, and more. </li>
