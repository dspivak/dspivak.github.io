<title>David Spivak -- ACT grants</title>

<meta name="description" content="David Spivak is a research scientist 
in the mathematics department at MIT.  His current research is on 
Categorical Informatics, i.e. using category theory to study information 
as it is used in the world.  Previous research subjects include Derived 
Manifolds, Infinity categories (a.k.a. quasi-categories), and Physics.>

<h2>Grants</h2>
<hr><br>

<h3> Current ACT grants</h3><br>
<a href="http://www.dspivak.net/grants/AFOSR2020-Topos-ContextDependence.pdf">Functorial Dynamics and Interaction.</a> 
Using polynomial functors to model dynamical systems, decision processes, data migration, and more! 
(I'm completely enthralled with the category Poly.) Funded as AFOSR grant FA0995-01-20-0348. Here is an application for a 
potential supplement
<a href="http://www.dspivak.net/grants/AFOSR2020-Topos-Supplement2021.pdf">Data-driven dynamics and collective decision-making</a>.
<br><br>

A <a href="https://github.com/dspivak/poly/">book</a> on the subject is in preparation. Idris code can be found 
<a href="https://github.com/dspivak/poly/blob/main/poly_up_to_fibonacci.idr">here</a>.

<h3> Past ACT grants</h3><br>

<br><br>
<a href="/grants/technical.pdf"> Databases and
Networks</a>. This is a 2008 proposal for the first grant I received from the ONR
(N000140910466).  In it, I propose to use category theory to study databases,
networks, and learning. A "summary for the admiral" is <a
href="http://math.mit.edu/~dspivak/informatics/spivak--cit--penta.pdf"> here</a>.
Here is the <a
href="./progressreportuo.pdf"> final
progress report</a> for it.  <br><br>

<a href="./lokey.pdf"> Networking
academia</a> The above ONR grant is in some sense a more technical version of this
earlier 2008 proposal, which I had earlier (unsuccessfully) submitted for a grant called
"Science and the Human Condition" at the University of Oregon.  The idea here is to
study networks, as found in computer science, economics, linguistics, sociology, and
biology, under a single mathematical framework.  The document is written for a
layperson. (Unfunded.)<br><br>

<a
href="./technical_proposal2010.pdf">
Categorical information theory</a>. This is a 2010 proposal for the second
incarnation, N000141010841, of the above ONR grant.  Here the focus
has shifted to studying systems of information. A final report for this
grant can be found <a
href="./FinalReport2013.pdf">
here</a>.<br><br>

<a href="./AFOSR--Proposal.pdf">
Categorical approach to agent interaction</a>. This is a 2012 proposal
to use category theory in the study of how agents communicate and interact
to form higher-level agents. AFOSR grant number FA9550-14-1-0031.<br><br>

<a href=
"./technical_proposalONR--2013.pdf">
Categorical informatics</a>. This is a 2013 proposal for the third
incarnation of
the ONR grant, N000141310260. Here the focus has shifted to some specific
problems in
databases, such as updates, hierarchy, aggregation, and non-atomic
fields. Here are progress reports from <a
href="./ProgressReport2013.pdf">
2013</a> and <a
href="./ProgressReport--Spivak--2014.pdf">
2014</a> and the <a
href="./ONRFinalReport2015.pdf">final
report</a>.<br><br>


<a
href="./NASA-Proposal.pdf">
Category-theoretic Approaches for the Analysis of Distributed Systems</a>.
This is a 2013 proposal (jointly with Honeywell) to use category
theory to consider the problem of
making high-assurance safety claims on systems composed of smaller
systems. NASA grant number NNH13ZEA001N-SSAT.
Here is the <a href=
"./Report_OADS.pdf"
>
progress report
</a>
for year 1. Here is NASA's <a href="./nasa_review_spivak.pdf">final review</a> of our work.<br><br>

<a href=
"./NSF_IIS.pdf">
Categorical informatics: A functorial approach to data integration
</a> This is a proposal for an
<a
href="http://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=503303&org=IIS">NSF
III</a> grant, submitted November 2015. (Unfunded.)

<br><br>

<a href=
"./NSF--ICorps.pdf">
Solving Information-Integration Problems Using Category Theory</a>.
Joint with Ryan Wisnesky (co-PI). This is
an <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/news/special_reports/i-corps/about.jsp">NSF
I-Corps</a> grant for
$50,000 to spend in Spring 2016 in order to find "product-market fit"
for the new company <a
href="http://catinf.com">Categorical Informatics Inc.</a><br><br>

<a href=
"./AFOSR--Proposal--PixMat--NoBudget.pdf">
Pixel matrices and other compositional analyses of interconnected systems
</a>. This is a 2016 proposal for a funded AFOSR grant to study compositional
analysis of systems. AFOSR grant number FA9550-17-1-0058.<br><br>

<a href="./AFOSR2018.pdf">
Categorical approach to agent interaction: Information, Communication, Planning, and Learning</a>.
This is a 2018 proposal for a second incarnation of "Categorical approach to agent interacton". 
AFOSR grant number FA9550-19-1-0113.
