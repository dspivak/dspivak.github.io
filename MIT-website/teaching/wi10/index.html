<title> Winter 2010 -- Informatics Seminar</title>

<meta name="description" content="In this graduate seminar we contemplate 
the question 'What is information?' and try to answer it in the language 
of mathematics.  We will use databases, ontologies, programming languages, 
and schematic diagrams as our sources of information, and try to fit their 
information into a category-theoretic framework.">

<h2>Winter 2010 -- Informatics Seminar</h2>

Meeting time: Tuesday and Thursday at 4pm<br>
Meeting place: 103 Peterson Hall.<br><br>

<h3><center>What is the mathematics of information?</center></h3>

<a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hilbert-program/">David Hilbert 
1928</a>: "the fundamental idea [of Spivak's Informatics Seminar] is 
none other than to describe the activity of our understanding, to make a 
protocol of the rules according to which our thinking actually proceeds."

<h3> Purpose of this seminar:</h3>

The world is too complex to understand, but aspects of it can be 
understood.  Some things which are understood can be expressed in words, 
not only for the purpose of mumbling to ourselves but for communicating to 
others.  Let's call anything of this form, anything that can be understood 
and communicated in words to others, "information."<br><br>

What is information?  What aspects of the world can be fully communicated?  
It seems that mathematics comes close to being "pure information."  Of 
course, people often define a set to be "a collection" (which is nothing 
more than a synonym for "a set") -- this is circular.  Thus we realize 
that even sets, the most basic objects of mathematical thought, are not 
<i> fully defined</i> in mathematics, so math is not really "pure"; it 
relies on agreement.  But perhaps that's fair.  Regardless, math certainly 
comes as close as anything else to being pure information.  <br><br>

Thus, whatever we define information to be, mathematics should be "at 
home" there.  This suggests perhaps that we <i>use</i> mathematics to 
define 
information; otherwise, math will always be a foreigner within our 
definition.  Defining 
information in terms of mathematics may be seen as circular in that 
math is seen both as a basic <i> kind </i>of information and as a language 
in which to 
<i>define</i> information.  The implications of this circularity require 
philosophical analysis, 
but we 
may begin to consider information in mathematical terms before having to 
take on that analysis. <br><br>

The goal of this seminar is to define a reasonable notion of 
"information," using mathematics as a foundation and language for the 
definition.  In particular, I will discuss my research in this direction.  
I began this research with the belief that the most appropriate vantage 
point from which to view information is category theory.  My studies have 
led me more specifically to topos theory.  <br><br>

While I don't yet have a finished definition, I do have a prototype: an 
<b>ontology log</b> (or <b>olog</b>) is a topos sketch.  In other words, 
it's a graph together with a set of diagrams that are said to commute, a 
set of diagrams which are said to be limits, and an object which 
represents those limits which enforce monomorphism.  The topos sketch 
may also be enriched in the monoidal category of sets of strings.  Less 
formally, an olog is a system of boxes and arrows, each labeled by english 
text, with some amount of the additional structure guaranteed by the 
axioms of a topos.  <br><br>

We each have our own olog (which is the situation as we see it, and the 
language we use to describe it).  The name "olog" is short for "ontology 
log", where ontology is a subject studied both in computer science and 
philosophy referring to "the way things are."  The word olog is supposed 
to be both reminiscent of "blog" and of the suffix "-ology", meaning the 
study of something.  Ologs are created by studying the way things are and 
logging it.<br><br>

The relation of ologs to blogs (weblogs) is that if everyone "ologs" 
the situation as they see it, 
and we attempt to connect our ologs together into one big human olog (in 
the appropriate topos-theoretic way), then we'll have a better 
understanding of each other's viewpoint on the world.  Information will 
flow between humans more readily and accurately.  I imagine a 
"Facebook" type system where users olog their ideas and lives, and 
connect them with their friends.  Doing so would force us to 
understand each other.  Moreover, computers would be able to 
"understand" us quite well.<br><br>

Your job in this course is to understand these ideas, to improve upon 
them, and to challenge them.

<h3>Ideas to consider:</h3>

1. <b>Global truth versus local truth.</b> Can something be true only 
   locally?  For example, should a pencil be considered "for all time and 
   space, a pencil" or just "for the last 5 days, a pencil". <br><br>

2. <b>Context.</b> Related to (1), information is always contextual.  In 
   other words, we are always looking at information from the viewpoint of 
   a certain audience (e.g. just myself).  Given a sensible 
"change-of-audience" morphism, should we
   get a change-of-information functor, that takes information from one 
   perspective to information from another?  Please consider 
slice-toposes and change-of-base 
functors in a topos and see how well they stack up to this idea.<br><br>

3. <b>Measurements.</b> Suppose we say something has weight 5 lbs.  What 
   does that mean?  It means that when we put it on a good scale, the 
   scale returns the number 5.  (What does it mean that the scale is 
   good?)  Does weight, as a function from physical objects to numbers, 
   exist as a stand-alone concept, or should it be considered only as
a function from 
pairs (physical object, scale) to numbers?  <br><br>

4. <b>Objects are like sets?</b> The objects in our ologs are labeled as 
   though they are sets (as one
   interprets a box labeled "a person" as the set of all persons).  Are 
   they?  Toposes are categories in which
   the objects feel like sets, but do not have to be such.  Perhaps 
we should think of objects as moduli spaces instead.  See "moduli 
space" email.<br><br>

5. <b>Parts of speech</b>. Objects in an olog should be labeled with noun 
phrases.  Morphisms 
   should be labeled with verb phrases.  Adjectives are used in noun 
phrases to 
   suggest subobject-hood.  As such, they should suggest a name for the 
   characteristic morphism corresponding to that subobject.    
Adverbs correspond to subobjects of exponential objects.<br><br>

6. <b>Two types of info?</b>  The <a 
href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/information-semantic/">
Stanford Encyclopedia article</a>  made a 
distinction between information that is 
instructional (e.g. a computer program) and information that is factual (e.g. like 
a database).  Is that distinction important?  How do ologs handle these two types 
of information?
