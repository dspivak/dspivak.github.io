David Spivak received a PhD in mathematics from UC Berkeley in 2007; 
his thesis was in algebraic topology. Noticing category theory's impressive 
ability to organize and layer abstractions and to interconnect widely 
different disciplines, he set out to show that mathematics' most abstract 
field was also its most applicable. After spending ten years at MIT, 
funded in part by NASA, the US departments of defense and commerce, and 
private companies, he co-founded Topos Institute, an independent non-profit 
research institute that works to shape technology for the public benefit by 
applying the language of category theory. David's work ranges from database 
integration to knowledge representation, from materials science to dynamical 
systems, all with a focus on compositionality and interoperability. He 
has written three books on applications of category theory.
Previous research subjects include Derived 
Manifolds, Infinity categories (a.k.a. quasi-categories), and Physics.

Among the tasks of this work are: to reconceptualize <i>the body</i> so that we could 
understand how focusing is possible, how we can feel complex situations, how the body can 
come up with an answer to a complex human living question we cannot figure out, how body and 
cognition are not just split apart. That obviously requires a different conception of the 
body than physiology currently offers.

As I figure it, everything that's here is constantly passing away. Now is passing. <br><br>

One might want to hold onto their youth, or their kids' youth, or a beautiful scene, or their 
life, but this is not possible. If one tries to circumvent this and tries to pin it down, the 
beautiful thing loses its value and often becomes ugly or perverted. <br><br>

All one can do, then, is to keep renewing one's appreciation now and then now and then now, 
for as long as one wants to and can. To me, the act of appreciating is one of simultaneously 
celebrating and mourning: celebrating that you get to experience something and mourning that 
this is the last time it will ever be this way.<br><br>

But these two emotions can be combined into a single orientation, and 
that's what I call appreciating. One might see it as celebrating and mourning, but it's 
really just one very poignant and beautiful feeling.

<h3> Past research subjects</h3><br>

<a href="./grants/index.html">Applied Category Theory</a>. Various ACT grants, some funded and others not.<br><br>

<a href="http://math.mit.edu/~dspivak/dman"> Derived manifolds</a>. The 
category of derived manifolds contains arbitrary intersections of 
manifolds, even if they are not transverse, while retaining enough 
structure so that every compact derived manifold has a fundamental class 
in cobordism.<br><br>

<a href="http://dspivak.net/qcmap.pdf"> Mapping spaces in 
quasi-categories</a>. Joint work with <a 
href="http://uoregon.edu/~ddugger"> Dan Dugger</a>.  <br><br>

<a href="./afsf.pdf"> Anomaly-free sets of fermions</a>. A 
physics paper I coauthored with <a
href="http://www.slac.stanford.edu/spires/find/hep/www?rawcmd=ea+Batra,+Puneet">
Puneet
Batra </a> and <a
href="http://www.slac.stanford.edu/spires/find/hep/www?rawcmd=ea+Dobrescu,+Bogdan+A">
Bogdan Dobrescu</a>.<br><br>
<a href="http://dspivak.net/metric_realization090922.pdf"> Metric realization of fuzzy simplicial sets</a> 
A draft I never published, and may contain errors, but which has gotten some attention from the creators of <a "https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.03426">UMAP</a> and others.
