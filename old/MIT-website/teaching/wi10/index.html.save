<h3>Reading list:</h3>



1. Lawvere and Schanuel.  <u>Conceptual 
Mathematics:
a first introduction to categories</u>.  An excellent book. <a 
href=http://www.amazon.com/Conceptual-Mathematics-First-Introduction-Categories$
>Amazon.com link</a><br><br>

2. Lawvere. <a 
href="http://tac.mta.ca/tac/reprints/articles/8/tr8.pdf"> Taking 
categories seriously</a> A great 25 page article, including how to think 
of dynamical systems from a categorical perspective.<br><br>

3. <a 
   href="http://www.math.uchicago.edu/~may/VIGRE/VIGRE2009/REUPapers/Henderson.pdf"> 
   A short paper on topoi</a>.  It is good, but I think that there is at 
   least one medium-sized error; ask me about it 
some time.<br><br>

4. <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/information-semantic/"> 
Stanford Encyclopedia entry on Information</a>.  I personally 
found sections 2.2 and 3.2.2 particularly relevant.  <br><br>

5. For topoi: Moerdijk and Mac Lane. <u> Sheaves in geometry and Logic: a 
first introduction to topos theory</u>.  <a 
href="http://www.amazon.com/Sheaves-Geometry-Logic-Introduction-Universitext/dp/0387977104/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1262994493&sr=1-1"> 
Amazon.com link</a> <br><br>

6. You may also find this page on my website interesting or relavant: <a

methods in computer science</a>.<br><br>

<h3> An appropriate amount of work for this class.</h3>

<h3>Ideas to consider.</h3>

1. <b>Global truth versus local truth.</b> Can something be true only 
   locally?  For example, should a pencil be considered "for all time and 
   space, a pencil" or just "for the last 5 days, a pencil". <br><br>

2. <b>Context.</b> Related to (1), information is always contextual.  In 
   other words, we are always looking at information from the viewpoint of 
   a certain audience (e.g. just myself).  Given a sensible 
"change-of-audience" morphism, should we
   get a change-of-information functor, that takes information from one 
   perspective to information from another?  Please consider 
slice-toposes and change-of-base 
functors in a topos and see how well they stack up to this idea.<br><br>

3. <b>Measurements.</b> Suppose we say something has weight 5 lbs.  What 
   does that mean?  It means that when we put it on a good scale, the 
   scale returns the number 5.  (What does it mean that the scale is 
   good?)  Does weight, as a function from physical objects to numbers, 
   exist as a stand-alone concept, or should it be considered only as
a function from 
pairs (physical object, scale) to numbers?  <br><br>

4. <b>Objects are like sets?</b> The objects in our ologs are labeled as 
   though they are sets (as one
   interprets a box labeled "a person" as the set of all persons).  Are 
   they?  Toposes are categories in which
   the objects feel like sets, but do not have to be such.  Perhaps 
we should think of objects as moduli spaces instead.<br><br>

5. <b>Parts of speech</b>. Objects should be labeled with noun phrases.  Morphisms 
   should be labeled with verb phrases.  Adjectives are used in noun phrases to 
   suggest subobject-hood.  As such, they should suggest a name for the 
   characteristic morphism corresponding to that subobject.  Do adverbs somehow 
correspond to subobjects of exponentials?  <br><br>

6. <b>Two types of info?</b>  The <a 
href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/information-semantic/">
Stanford Encyclopedia article</a>  made a 
distinction between information that is 
instructional (e.g. a computer program) and information that is factual (e.g. like 
a database).  Is that distinction important?  How do ologs handle these two types 
of information?

<h3>Meta-ideas to consider</h3>

I want you to call me out; to the extent it's done appropriately, I  
respect and appreciate it.  I'm into honesty as much as possible, both within 
class and without, and in particular I don't 
want you to protect me from an honest thought of yours about this material.  
<br><br>

This theory of informatics, "ologs," is very much a work in progress.  And I
literally  want
your help: You are a junior mathematician with an interest in the theory of 
information -- you are the ideal people to help with this project.  As mentioned in 
the syllabus, I'd 
like this seminar to be an
opportunity for all of us.  Not only do I hope everyone gets something good out of 
this 
class, but we have the opportunity to come up with something really interesting 
together.  <br><br>

Ologs are about honesty.  They are about what is really going on.  What do we 
really mean when we say "...."?   If you don't know how to say something, 
contemplate it and 
find a way to say it.<br><br>
