<center><h3>"Mathematics is the pursuit of that upon which 
we can surely agree."</h3></center> 

Essential to success in anything is the capacity to duplicate success, to 
make it happen again.  However, success in a given situation depends on 
the precise nature of the situation, and this situation will never be 
precisely repeated.  Hence we must find "invariants" of the situation, 
i.e. ways to describe it, which may be recognized in other situations and 
hence clue us in to the possibility of a similar success.<br><br>

An individual creating such a description for himself may use his own 
jargon, so long as he will understand it in the future.  (Within the 
scientific model, we would note that a neuronal firing pattern in his 
brain may serve as "jargon" in this sense -- an identifiable pattern used 
to indicate something.)  He may also jot down some notes, or 
write himself a manual.  Regardless of its form, in order to 
be effective, this description must be informative to the person at a 
later time, so that he may 
act in accord with it.<br><br>

This may be seen as a more primative form of communication -- the person 
in the present communicates to the person he imagines himself to be in the 
future.  Certainly not all actions by the person in the present would 
serve as working communications.  Again, to be useful, a communication 
must be informative, whatever that may mean.  Creating an informative 
communication, whether between two people or between a person and his 
later self, relies on correctly determining a set of similarities between 
two communicating entities.  These similarities, agreements, and 
conventions serve as the basic materials used for building or structuring 
a communication.

<center><h4>What is the structure of informative 
communication?</h4></center>

The issue of duplicating success in tandem with another person is similar, 
but even more difficult.  As the observation of others is less direct than 
the observation of the self, it is harder to know what actions we can take 
to be informative to the other, and hence build a working relationship.  
Still, a primary goal in any agreeable relationship is to create working 
communication.  This requires finding a set of similarities with which to 
build the communication.  The purpose of culture is to have such a set of 
similarities "ready-made."  Here, I intend the word culture to include 
groups like native english speakers, academics, members of a tribe, or 
even a group consisting of just one individual -- a culture of one. 
When people are instilled with a set of shared experiences 
and understandings, communication becomes possible.  <br><br>

To study effective communication, it is useful to ask: "what are the types 
of things upon which we can come to agreement, and how can we communicate 
them?"  It seems that mathematics is our best attempt to create 
unambiguous agreement.  It also may be the case that mathematics is the 
appropriate language and environment in which to create a working 
definition of communication itself and to explore its possibilities.  In 
this 
regard, we ask "what is the mathematical structure of communication and 
information?"


<h4><center>"Information is the new physics."</center></h4>

In the modern world, information is increasingly becoming a commodity -- it's 
value is becoming increasingly apparent.  Whereas the "physical world" (the 
world as studied by physics) is hypothesized to be lacking in deliberacy, our 
human world is just the opposite: our concerns are intent, purpose, and 
meaning.  In order for me to bring an intention to fruition, I must know 
exactly what I mean, what it is that I want to occur.  This object of my
intention is really nothing more than structured meaning -- anything I want 
is simply a concept I have, but a very precise one.  In order to manifest it, 
I must know exactly what it is.  <br><br>

We are often intending and meaning things, and hoping to inform others of 
our intentions so that they may help.  The desire to achieve success more 
frequently -- not specific success but just success generally in life -- 
this itself is an intention, albeit of a "higher" order. At this level our 
goal becomes to know what success itself is. Success begins with creating 
a desired outcome, a set of observations that will be the case in order to 
declare success. The desired outcome is not yet present -- it is imagined 
-- but it has some resemblance to the current situation. How are these 
similarities and differences understood? The issue rests on knowing what 
information is.  Once we know what information is, we will be more 
effective at using it to describe situations, and hence achieve our 
purposes more easily.<br><br>

We must search for a model of information which is both flexible and 
rigorous and which is able to clearly and effectively describe all 
imaginable types of information.<br><br>

Using mathematics to model the physical universe has proven quite 
successful (for both math and physics).  To model the world of 
communication and information we begin by finding better ways to classify, 
organize, and process information.  To understand what information is, we 
must first understand what it does, how it works.  For this, we should 
again turn to mathematics.

<center><h4>Category theory is the mathematics of structure.</h4></center>

I think that category theory has a lot to offer in this regard.  In order 
to find somewhere to start, I've been 
working on aspects of computer science which are relevant to the goal of understanding 
information.  The idea is that 
we already <em>do</em> have ways of classifying, organizing, and processing information; 
by modeling them mathematically, we can understand their conceptual underpinnings, which 
in turn can help us create new and better systems in the 
future.<br><br><hr>
