<h2>Final Review</h2>

<br><br>

You will only be tested on material like that which was suggested for
homework.  There will be no cosh or sinh, nor integration which requires
partial fractions or trigonometric substitution.

<br>

The following problems from Stewart's chapter reviews may be helpful for
finding which topics are difficult for you.  Once you locate these topics,
study them (either in your own way, if that is effective for you, or by
using the guidelines in "Effective Study").

<br>

You should understand the ideas internally, rather than only getting to a
point where you are "able to do it."  The reason is that truly
understanding things requires less effort, strain, and stress than
memorizing does.  True understanding requires more work, but has much more
reward too (and I don't just mean in the next life!).

<h3>HOMEWORK (from Stewart).</h3>

Homework should be done according to the following guide: <a

In order to do well on the quizzes and tests, you should be able to do all 
of the suggested problems; however, you are not required to actually do 
them all on your homework.  Do as many as you need to, in order to feel 
comfortable that you <i> could </i> do any of them.<br>
