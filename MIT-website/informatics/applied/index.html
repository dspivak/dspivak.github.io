<a href="http://math.mit.edu/~dspivak/informatics/olog.pdf"> Ologs: a 
category-theoretic foundation for knowledge representation</a>. Joint with 
Robert E. Kent. In this paper we present an application of basic category 
theory to the field of knowledge representation.  Ontology is the study of 
what something is, the intrinsic nature of a subject.  Ologs, or ontology 
logs, are a framework for recording the results of such a study by breaking 
it down into types (objects), aspects (arrows), and facts (commutative 
diagrams).  Functors between ologs can create translating dictionaries 
between various perspectives on a subject, and set-valued functors amount to 
instance data or "real world examples" for the system of concepts an olog.

Category-theoretic analysis of hierarchical protein materials and social

PLoS ONE</a>. In this paper
we use an olog to rigorously compare and contrast the structure of two
proteins and their resulting behaviors under strain. We then compare this
whole setup with that of a social network, contrived to have the same
olog-theoretic description. The examples reviewed here demonstrate that
the intrinsic nature of these complex systems, which in particular
includes a precise relationship between their structure and their
function, can be effectively represented by an olog. This, in turn, allows
for comparative studies between disparate materials or fields of
application, and result in novel approaches to derive functionality in
hierarchical systems. We discuss opportunities and challenges associated
with the description of complex biological materials by using ologs as a
powerful tool for analysis and design in the context of materiomics, and
we present the potential impact of this approach for engineering, life
sciences, and medicine. On the <a
