<a
href="http://math.mit.edu/~dspivak/informatics/CatData.pdf">
Algebraic databases</a>. Joint with Patrick Schultz, Christina 
Vasilakopoulou, Ryan Wisnesky. Here we understand attributes and null 
values in a database, using algebraic theories. The theoretical 
contributions include a notion of algebraic profunctor, a development of 
the collage construction, and a new proarrow equipment of "variable 
algebras" of a theory.<br><br>


<a href="http://math.mit.edu/~dspivak/informatics/CD-FDM.pdf"> 
Functorial Data 
Migration.</a> This was <a 
href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0890540112001010"> published 
</a> in the journal <a 
href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/08905401">Information and 
Computation</a> in 2012. In this paper I show some of the power of the database=category 
idea: a morphism of schemas induces data migration functors that transmit states on one 
schema to states on the other.  This creates such functionality as views, unions, joins, 
projects, selects, etc.  An older version is <a 
href="http://math.mit.edu/~dspivak/informatics/FunctorialDataMigration.pdf"> here</a>, 
and both are available on the <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1009.1166"> arXiv</a>. A 
5-part video series (totalling ~1 hour) on roughly this subject can be found <a 
href="http://math.mit.edu/~dspivak/informatics/introTalk/"> here</a>.<br><br>

<a href="http://math.mit.edu/~dspivak/informatics/relfound.pdf"> On The 
Relational Foundations Of Functorial Data Migration</a>. Joint with <a 
href="http://wisnesky.net/">Ryan 
Wisnesky</a>. A syntactic version of the above Functorial Data Migration 
paper, with more details about query composition, equivalences, 
and containment. On the <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1212.5303"> 
arXiv</a>.<br><br>

<a href="http://math.mit.edu/~dspivak/informatics/SD.pdf"> Simplicial
databases</a>.  A geometric model of databases.  In this model, a
"schema" for a database is a labeled simplicial set, whose n-simplicies
correspond to tables with n+1 columns.  We form a simplicial set by taking
the union of such simplices, and doing so reflects the links between
objects of differing types.  The data itself is then a sheaf on the
corresponding site.  This category of databases is closed under limits and
colimits and these functors correspond to common operations on databases,
such as joins, selects, and unions. On the <a
href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0904.2012"> arXiv</a>.<br>

I gave a talk on this subject at the 2008 <a
href="http://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/~sanjeevi/atmcs/"> ATMCS</a>
meeting
in Paris, and wrote a more brief survey of the ideas <a
href="http://math.mit.edu/~dspivak/informstics/atmcs-gd.pdf"> here</a>.
written out as a .pdf document. <br>

A primitive version of this talk in which I only discuss the category of
tables, was given as a colloquium in the University of Oregon computer
science department.  It can be found <a
href="http://math.mit.edu/~dspivak/informatics/colloquium.pdf">
here</a>.<br><br>

<a 
href="http://math.mit.edu/~dspivak/informatics/sd-table_manipulation.pdf"> 
Table manipulation in simplicial databases.</a> This short note exemplifies 
the fact that the geometric structure of simplicial databases has concrete 
meaning.  On the <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1003.2682"> arXiv</a>.

<a href="http://math.mit.edu/~dspivak/informatics/database-model.pdf">Type 
theoretical databases</a>. Simplicial databases from the perspective of 
type theory. Joint with H. Forssell and H.R. Gylterud.<br><br>

<a href="http://math.mit.edu/~dspivak/informatics/HDMSN.pdf">
Higher-dimensional
models of
networks</a>.  In this paper, I make a case that many networks involve interactions
between more than two entities, and as such should not be modeled by graphs but by
simplicial sets.  I give a variety of other models and suggest ways to determine which
model is most applicable for a given situation, and how to transform models from one type
into another.  The paper is written mainly for a CS audience familiar with the basics of
category theory.  It can also be found on the <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/0909.4314">
arXiv</a>.  A more mathematical paper on networks and information processing is in
the works.<br><br>

<a href="http://math.mit.edu/~dspivak/informatics/LiftingProblems.pdf">
Database queries and constraints via lifting problems</a>. 
(Published by <a 
href="http://journals.cambridge.org/repo_A90V5ODg">
Mathematical 
structures in computer science</a>.) In this paper I show 
that database queries and constraints, especially so-called "graph pattern 
queries", are nicely modeled in terms of the algebro-topological notion of <i> 
lifting problems </i> (which one encounters, for example, in Quillen's theory 
of model categories). The lifting problem is the query and the lifts are the 
solutions. Also available on the 
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1202.2591">arXiv</a>.<br><br>

<a href="http://math.mit.edu/~dspivak/informatics/monadsInDatabases.pdf"> 
Kleisli database instances</a>. Here we use monads to allow non-atomic 
values in database fields. For example depending on the choice of monad, a 
column may contain lists, probability distributions, or vectors of entries 
in some foreign table. As an interesting aside, we show that there is a 
schema Loop, whose Kleisli T-instances for different monads T completely 
capture classical structures of interest, such as directed graphs, 
discrete dynamical systems, Markov chains, multi-graphs, finite state 
automata, Turing Machines, and square matrices. Also available on the 
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1209.1011">arXiv</a>.<br><br>

<a href="http://math.mit.edu/~dspivak/informatics/undirectedWD.pdf">The 
operad of wiring diagrams</a>. Here I discuss a symmetric colored operad S 
of wiring diagrams, which can be used as a graphical language for database 
queries. I also show that the same formalism fits the classical theory of 
digital circuits, as well as the notion of plug-and-play and 
recursion. Also available on the <a 
href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.0297"> arXiv</a>.<br><br>

<a 
href="http://math.mit.edu/~dspivak/informatics/DirectedWiringDiagrams.pdf">The 
operad of temporal wiring diagrams</a>. Joint with <a 
href="http://www.northeastern.edu/drupel/"> Dylan Rupel</a>. We discuss an 
operad of wiring diagrams, whose purpose is to formalize the 
hierarchical nature of processes. We prove that there is an algebra of 
stream processors. This may have applications to computer hardware design and 
neuroscience. Also available on the <a
href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.6894">arXiv</a>.<br><br>

<a href="http://math.mit.edu/~dspivak/informatics/WD-ODE.pdf">Algebras of 
open dynamical systems on the operad of wiring diagrams</a>. Joint with <a 
href="http://fds.duke.edu/db/aas/math/grad/dv/">Dmitry Vagner</a> and <a 
href="http://www.math.uiuc.edu/~lerman/">Eugene Lerman</a>. We show that 
open multivariable dynamical systems form an algebra on an operad of 
wiring diagrams. Also available on the <a 
href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.1598">arXiv</a>.<br><br>

<a 
href="http://math.mit.edu/~dspivak/informatics/mode-dependentNetworks.pdf"
>Nesting of dynamic systems and mode-dependent networks</a>. I show that 
you can build networks of dynamic systems, in which the dynamics can 
change the network architecture in real time. Also available on 
the <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.07380">arXiv</a>.<br><br>
