David Spivak's website is down today, 2013 April 22, to protest CISPA, the 
Cyber 
Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act.<br><br>

Here is an excerpt from <a

wikipedia.org</a>: <br><br>

CISPA has been criticized by advocates of Internet privacy and civil 
liberties, such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation, the American Civil 
Liberties Union, Fight for the Future, and Avaaz.org, as well as various 
conservative and libertarian groups including the Competitive Enterprise 
Institute, TechFreedom, FreedomWorks, Americans for Limited Government, 
Liberty Coalition, and the American Conservative Union. Those groups argue 
CISPA contains too few limits on how and when the government may monitor a 
private individualâ€™s Internet browsing information. Additionally, they 
fear that such new powers could be used to spy on the general public 
rather than to pursue malicious hackers. CISPA had garnered favor 
from corporations and lobbying groups such as Microsoft, Facebook, AT&T, 
IBM, Apple and the United States Chamber of Commerce, which look on it as 
a simple and effective means of sharing important cyber threat information 
with the government.<br><br>

<b>ACLU</b>: "The Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection 
Act would create a cybersecurity exception to all privacy laws and allow 
companies to share the private and personal data they hold on their 
American customers with the government for cybersecurity 
purposes. Beyond the potential for massive data collection 
authorization, the bill would provide no meaningful oversight of, or 
accountability for, the use of these new information-sharing 
authorities."<br><br>
<b>The Sunlight Foundation</b>: "The new cybersecurity bill, CISPA, 
or HR 
3523, is terrible on transparency. The bill proposes broad new information 
collection and sharing powers (which many other organizations are covering 
at length). Even as the bill proposes those powers, it proposes to limit 
public oversight of this work."<br><br>

<b>Mozilla</b>: "While we wholeheartedly support a more secure Internet, 
CISPA has a broad 
and alarming reach that goes far beyond Internet security."<br><br>

<b>The Association of Computing Machinery</b>: "More 
effective 
information sharing in support of cybersecurity is a laudable goal, but 
CISPA is seriously flawed in its approach to PII. Better approaches to 
information sharing are certainly possible if privacy goals are also 
considered."<br><br>
